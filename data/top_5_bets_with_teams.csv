At +110 odds for over 5.5 rebounds, SGA hitting his weighted average makes this a strong bet with positive expected value.",https://nba-bets-data.s3.amazonaws.com/avatars/shai_gilgeous-alexander.png,Oklahoma City Thunder
5e04b91f-48f1-466e-9d57-c3e6af5c3c61,2025-06-17,Indiana Pacers vs Oklahoma City Thunder,Chet Holmgren,Assists,Over,1.5,2.16,2.12,0.748,0.616,6.16,"Chet Holmgren's 2.12 weighted average for assists makes the over 1.5 a good value against the Thunder. He's exceeded this total in three of his last five games, and Oklahoma City allows the 6th most assists to opposing centers. Holmgren's recent production and the matchup suggest he could hit this over at positive expected value.",https://nba-bets-data.s3.amazonaws.com/avatars/chet_holmgren.png,Oklahoma City Thunder
fdf26279-5684-4097-a5df-b14a6861b463,2025-06-17,Indiana Pacers vs Oklahoma City Thunder,Obi Toppin,Rebounds,Under,4.5,2.14,3.88,0.748,0.601,6.01,"Obi Toppin has been averaging under 4 rebounds per game this season, and against the Thunder's solid rebounding numbers, going under 4.5 looks like a pretty safe bet. With an expected value above 0.6, this prop on Toppin to grab fewer than 4.5 boards seems like decent value given his season-long average and the matchup tonight.",https://nba-bets-data.s3.amazonaws.com/avatars/obi_toppin.png,Indiana Pacers
674bd54d-bd9e-458e-9ec6-959c14de301f,2025-06-17,Indiana Pacers vs Oklahoma City Thunder,Alex Caruso,Assists,Over,2.5,1.98,3.25,0.75,0.485,4.85,"Alex Caruso dishing out over 2.5 assists against the Thunder looks like a strong possibility tonight. He's been averaging 3.25 assists over his last 5 games playing against Oklahoma City's defense, which tends to give up a lot of opportunities for guards like Caruso to facilitate for others. At close to even money on the prop betting line, taking the over on Caruso's assists seems like a solid value bet given his recent production against this team.",https://nba-bets-data.s3.amazonaws.com/avatars/alex_caruso.png,Oklahoma City Thunder

At nearly 14 to win 100, Turner scoring over 13.5 points seems quite likely based on his production and the matchup, making this a solid value bet tonight.",https://nba-bets-data.s3.amazonaws.com/avatars/myles_turner.png,Indiana Pacers
